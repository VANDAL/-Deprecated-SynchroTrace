#SYNCHROTRACE

There are two tools which together form the prototype SynchroTrace simulation flow built into Gem5.
	1) Sigil - Multi-threaded Trace Capture Tool
	2) Replay - Event-Trace Replay Framework

This code base includes (2) Replay. 
Currently, the Sigil version required to generate traces is provided separately from the same github user "dpac-vlsi".
	
The logical steps to using this simulation environment for design space exploration or CMP simulation is as follows:
	1)
	  a) Generate Multi-threaded Event Traces for the program binary you are testing (See Sigil documentation for further information):
		-Use the Sigil wrapping script (runsigil_and_gz_newbranch.py) with necessary options on your binary
	   OR
	  b) Use previously generated or sample traces
	2) Compile SynchroTrace (For a list of dependencies, please look in the Additional Notes section below)
	3) Run SynchroTrace with necessary options on the generated traces

#####Installing SynchroTrace and Running the 8 Thread FFT Example

1) Check Necessary Dependencies:
   gcc-4.4.7
   gmp-5.1.1
   mpc-1.0
   mpfr-3.1.2
   swig-2.0.1
   python-2.7.6
   scons-2.3.0
   zlib-dev or zlib1g-dev
   m4

   - Please note: 
	a) Runtime problems have been encountered when using later versions of swig and gcc.

	b) Please ensure /usr/bin/gcc-4.4 is symbolically linked to your defaultgcc (/usr/bin/gcc)

	c) gmp, mpc, and mpfr are packaged with gcc when using package installer such as apt.

	d) swig-2.0.1 can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swig/swig-2.0.1/

	e) Currently we do not provide any means to automatically install the missing packages.

2) Build SynchroTrace

  a) If not done so, clone the SynchroTrace repo from GitHub:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dpac-vlsi/SynchroTrace
```
  b) Go to the base SynchroTrace directory

  c) Run the following command (Note that the number of jobs refers to the number of cores available for compilation):
     
```sh
     scons build/X86_MESI_CMP_directory/gem5.opt --jobs=6
```
At this point, the gem5 executable should be built with integrated Trace Replay in the location specified in the command above.

gem5 is usually run with a configuration script that hooks up the various architecture models packaged with the gem5 framework.
We have written a SynchroTrace configuration script to which arguments can be passed to configure the desired system.

This script can be found at <SYNCHROTRACE_FOLDER>/configs/synchrotrace/synchrotrace.py

The run_synchrotrace_fft.pl run script can be used to run the FFT example simply as follows:

```sh
$ ./run_synchrotrace_fft.pl
```

This script can be modified and emulated to run your own configuration.
A different trace location by changing the $eventDir variable.
This design being simulated is set by changing the arguments provided in the $synchrotracecmd variable.
For a list of valid arguments, run the following from the main SynchroTrace folder:

```sh
$ ./build/X86_MESI_CMP_directory/gem5.opt ./configs/synchrotrace/synchrotrace.py --help
```

  d) Once the run is completed, simulated metrics can be found in m5out/stats.txt and m5out/ruby.stats

#####Additional Notes:

1) Sample Sigil Traces are located in $BASESYNCHROTRACEDIR/sample_sigil_traces

2) SynchroTrace configurations are located in $BASESYNCHROTRACEDIR/configs/synchrotrace/synchrotrace.py and $BASESYNCHROTRACEDIR/configs/ruby/Ruby.py

3) The run_synchrotrace_fft.pl run script has a section for debug flags. The following is a list of the available debug flags used by SynchroTrace with brief descriptions.

-DebugFlag('mutexLogger') - Prints order of threads obtaining mutex lock
-DebugFlag('printEvent') - Prints EventID# for specific thread before/after event started/completed. This debug flag makes the simulation time very slow.
-DebugFlag('printEventFull') - Prints EventIDs for Threads, Threads on what Cores every 50k cycles
-DebugFlag('cacheMiss') - Prints out cache misses as they happen and address 
-DebugFlag('memoryInBarrier') - prints memory reads, writes, read bytes, write bytes every barrier
-DebugFlag('flitsInBarrier') - prints flits generated every barrier
-DebugFlag('l1MissesInBarrier') - prints l1 misses per thread every barrier
-DebugFlag('latencyInBarrier') - prints 3 lines. # packets in barrier, Accumulated queueing delay in barrier, Accumulated network latency in Barrier.
-DebugFlag('powerStatsInBarrier') - prints the total router power specifically for that barrier, i.e. not a rolling average.
-DebugFlag('roi') - Prints out the cycle when we reach the parallel region in Debate. Prints out when the threads all join up.
-DebugFlag('netMessages') - Prints the network packet messages out at 10k cycle buckets.
-DebugFlag('amTrace') - Original default debug flag.

4) An example of this command with a debug flag is as follows:
./build/X86_MESI_CMP_directory/gem5.opt --debug-flags=printEventFull ./configs/synchrotrace/synchrotrace.py --garnet-network=fixed --topology=Mesh --mesh-rows=8 --eventDir=$eventDir --outputDir=$outputDir --num-cpus=8 --num_threads=8 --num-dirs=8 --num-l2caches=8 --l1d_size=8kB --l1d_assoc=16 --l1i_size=8kB --l1i_assoc=2 --l2_size=128kB --l2_assoc=4 --cpi_iops=1 --cpi_flops=2 --bandwidth_factor=4 --l1_latency=3 --masterFreq=1 2> fft.err";

where the $eventDir points to the directory of the traces and $outputDir points to the desired output directory path.
